However, this position does not have to correspond to the degree of actual opening, i.e. 25% running time is not equal to 25% opening. In order to achieve an exact approach to the correct opening, an assignment of position and corresponding running time must be made. Since the percentage opening degree with HM of 100% means 'Open' and 0% means 'Closed', but with 25% it is assumed that the roller shutter has only been lowered 1/4, the assignment is exactly the other way round." }
